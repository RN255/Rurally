## Project Name: Rurally
This is a website for a fictional company called "Rurally". 
The company specialises in bringing tech to the countryside and helping businesses grow.
The website contains information on their products and services, a message from the CEO, news, recruitment information and contact infromation. There is also a privacy policy.

## Motivation
I contacted the CEO of the company this website is modelled on. He said I was not good enough to be employed there so I thought a good next step was to try and recreate their main web site. The original website is here: https://dreamly.se/

## Tech used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project features
- embedded videos
- side scrolling carousel/menu of various sizes
- well developed footer section
- footer contains links to specific page sections
- large amount of information
- fully responsive web design
- full screen menu activated by hamburger button when viewed on mobile

## Lessons learnt
- The main challenge was that this web site was much larger than what I had done before. Otherwise, I knew what to do.
- I learnt a few things about the sidewards scrolling carousels.

## future development
- The products and services do not have their own detailed web pages
- The original website had an additional fixed contact button at the bottom right of the screen

## How to use
Website is live at: https://rn255.github.io/Rurally/
